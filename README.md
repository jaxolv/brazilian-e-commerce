# Brazilian E-Commerce from Olist Store

This project uses the [Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) for **study**, **documentation**, and **technical skill demonstration** in **SQL, Python, and Power BI**. Although it's a personal project, it is structured as a public portfolio.
